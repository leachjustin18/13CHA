Created a test using radio buttons. This test consist of four questions.  After answering one question a box will appear showing if you got it right or wrong. Under that box a button will show with a value of Next Question. When pressed the button will hide the current question, show the next question, enable the radio buttons again and clear out all answers.  To make this project better I concentrated more on using loops to test, that way I created one function, instead of 4 seperate ones.
